# mern-docker
Just playing with docker, docker-compose, MongoDB, React and ExpressJS.

This project demonstrates how to successfully create docker images for a react app and an express API service and have these images run alongside each other and a MongoDB container. 

To start the network:
1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have a Docker Daemon running, then run this command at the root folder of the repository:
  sudo docker-compose up -d
3. To view the React App, open localhost:3000 on your browser.
4. To stop the network, run this command:
    sudon docker-compose down
